# Introduction #
I created a Power BI Dashboard to explore Hollywood movies performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and cleaning process were completed in Python and new dataset was exported into Power BI for visualisation. Colours used have to match with client's brand colours (Blue, Green and Brown).

Highlighted techniques: Python EDA, data cleaning, treemap, lines chart, Bar Charts, Column Charts, etc.
