# Introduction #
I created a Power BI report to explore Covid-19 statistics.

In this exercise, I implemented exploratory data analysis, set up Star model relationships, and built different visualisations. Particularly, I carried out analyses for Covid-19 cases, hospitalisation and tests & vaccinations based on figures across the globe.

Highlighted Techniques used: data model & EDA, drill down hierarchy, measures and calculated columns, maps, Scatterplot, area chart, lines chart, Tables, Bar Charts, Column Charts, etc.
